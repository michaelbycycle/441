For this assignment, I spent most time reviewing the box model.<br>

Most of my issues arose from trying to implement a fixed header and the cascade of layout issues that ensued to make the rest of the page's layout work in context with a fixed header.  To implement a fixed header, I had to look into creating a fixed position for the coordinates of the header at position 0. I also was trying to offset the wrapper container down the page in order to start it at the bottom of the main content wrapper.<br>

In addition to the fixed header, I was having issues in making the 3 content section divs have top and bottom margins seperating each other from themselves as well as from the top and bottom of the main wrapper container.
