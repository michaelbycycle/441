			<p>I currently am enrolled at the Missoula College to become a full stack developer.  I plan on 
				graduating either the spring of 2022 or the fall of 2022.  My favorite courses so far have been

			<p>My perspective of the world currently is large percentage of people are in a holding pattern due to 
				the current pandemic.  Unfortunately, this is a sad situation since people are being stifled in
				living their lives.  On a positive note, I believe energy cannot be destroyed so people's energy 
				is being stored and also I believe hard times speed up the evolution humankind.  Hopefuly, these
				two elements will lead to an improvement for the world.
