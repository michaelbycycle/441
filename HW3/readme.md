This assignment was a bit of a head scratcher.  I found it difficult it to grasp how the .innerhtml of the buttons paired with
the ID of the button element and the parameter function attached to the button all worked together.

The end result was the ability to have the button text and story div to change their .innerhtml which allowed for a choose your
own adventure type website.  During this assignment, I wrote out the flow of the script through using a tree strucure.  This was helpful
to see the layout of the nodes among the 3 progressions.  It was enlightening to see how the first progression had 1 node with 2 options, the 
second had 2 nodes with a total of four options, and the third progression had four options wiht 8 options.
